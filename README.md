I'm April.

I like Windows internals, I have an obsession with breaking software, I'm also interested in the JVM, and I am familiar with hypervisor development.

I have 12 cats, I live in the UK & I love my friends. I daily drive a Windows system with an R7 9700X & 7700XT. I also have many random computers/laptops.

I am experienced with:
- Hardware/vulnerability research
- JVM/Windows internals
- Game hacking & malware development
- NixOS/Nix
- Linux/Windows/Mac
- Full-stack web development
